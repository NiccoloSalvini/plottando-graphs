### IG-out:



### Description:

This repo sets up together all the work in plottin  I have been putting all around projects. It also make my visualization code fast reproducible. Moreover It allows me to have a glance of the visualization communication power wrt to its goal, aaand to have a clue of which type of data are suited for this; eg maps need long and lat ... They are all mainly based on `ggplot2` and `Plotly`, but sometimes other represenation are take from other packages. the **libs.R** will clear up the libraries that I am using throughout the project.
